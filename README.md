## Project Overview

This repository hosts code used in second project on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) project in the Deep Learning Nanodegree. In addition to meeting the project specifications, I also added on a few things. 

Given an image of a dog, the algorithm will identify an estimate of the canine’s breed.  If supplied an image of a human, it will identify the resembling dog breed.  

## Getting started
Open the `dog_app.ipynb` on a GPU enabled Python notebook environment. The notebook consists of further technical details. Run the notebook to classify your own dog images.

A flask webapp has been created that detects dogs or humans.
